This project is a simple To-do-List for my school's Javascript course. It has a input box for tasks, which you can add as many tasks as you want.

You can cross the tasks by clicking on them and deleting with double click. Unfortunately the project has one problem, which I couldn't solve; It occurs, when you refresh the page. The localStorage does not return the tasks crossed (if I have done that).

You can see the app in action here in [Netlify](https://heartfelt-fudge-b66112.netlify.app/)
